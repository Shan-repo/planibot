He worked dedicatedly as a team player and never hesitated on picking up new task with minimal supervision. I felt like we haven’t utilised his complete skillset due to restrained environment and limited engagement.Resources like him are hard to find and I wish him every success in his future endeavours!! Will be more than happy to engage him back if any opportunity arises!"
